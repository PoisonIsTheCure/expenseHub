# üéâ ExpenseHub New Features Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the new features implemented in ExpenseHub, including Expense Splitting Methods, Balances & Settlements, Expense Categories & Analytics, and Recurring Expenses.

---

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. üíµ Expense Splitting Methods

Household expenses can now be split in multiple ways:

#### Split Methods Available:
- **Equal Split** (default): Divides expense equally among all household members
- **Percentage Split**: Uses predefined member weights/percentages for splitting
- **Custom Split**: Manually specify how much each member owes
- **None**: No split, only the payer owes

#### Backend Implementation:
- **Models Updated**:
  - `Expense` model now includes `paidBy`, `splitMethod`, and `splitDetails` fields
  - `Household` model includes `defaultSplitMethod` and `memberWeights`

- **New Utilities**: `backend/src/utils/splitCalculations.ts`
  - `calculateSplitDetails()`: Calculates split amounts based on method
  - `calculateHouseholdBalances()`: Computes member balances
  - `simplifyDebts()`: Optimizes debt settlements

#### API Endpoints:
All expense endpoints automatically calculate split details when creating/updating expenses.

---

### 2. ü§ù Balances & Settlements

Track who owes whom and settle debts efficiently.

#### Features:
- **Balance Tracking**: Automatic calculation of what each member has paid vs. owes
- **Simplified Debts**: Algorithm minimizes the number of transactions needed
- **Settlement Recording**: Log payments between members
- **Settlement Status**: Track pending, completed, or cancelled settlements

#### Backend Implementation:
- **New Model**: `Settlement` (`backend/src/models/Settlement.ts`)
- **Controller**: `settlementController.ts`

#### API Endpoints:
```
GET    /api/settlements/households/:householdId/balances    # Get balances

## üîë Key Features in Action

### Creating a Split Expense

When creating an expense for a household:
```javascript
{
  amount: 100,
  description: "Groceries",
  category: "Groceries",
  householdId: "household_id",
  splitMethod: "equal",     // Will split ‚Ç¨100 equally
  paidBy: "user_id"         // Who paid
}
```

The backend automatically calculates `splitDetails` for all members.

### Recording a Settlement

```javascript
{
  householdId: "household_id",
  toUserId: "recipient_id",
  amount: 50.00,
  notes: "Rent payment for March"
}
```

### Viewing Analytics

Visit `/analytics` page and:
1. Toggle between Personal and Household views
2. Select a household to see collective analytics
3. View spending trends, top categories, and month comparisons

### Creating Recurring Expenses

```javascript
{
  amount: 1200,
  description: "Monthly Rent",
  category: "Bills & Utilities",
  frequency: "monthly",
  startDate: "2025-01-01",
  householdId: "household_id",
  splitMethod: "equal"
}
```

The scheduler will automatically create expenses on the due dates.

## üìä Database Schema Changes

### Expense Collection:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  paidBy: ObjectId,
  splitMethod: "equal" | "percentage" | "custom" | "none",
  splitDetails: [{
    userId: ObjectId,
    amount: Number,
    percentage: Number
  }]
}
```

### Household Collection:
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  memberRoles: [{
    userId: ObjectId,
    role: "owner" | "admin" | "member" | "viewer"
  }],
  defaultSplitMethod: String,
  memberWeights: [{
    userId: ObjectId,
    weight: Number,
    percentage: Number
  }]
}
```

### Settlement Collection (New):
```javascript
{
  householdId: ObjectId,
  fromUserId: ObjectId,
  toUserId: ObjectId,
  amount: Number,
  currency: String,
  status: "pending" | "completed" | "cancelled",
  settlementDate: Date,
  notes: String,
  proofOfPayment: {...},
  timestamps: true
}
```

### RecurringExpense Collection (New):
```javascript
{
  amount: Number,
  description: String,
  category: String,
  frequency: "daily" | "weekly" | "biweekly" | "monthly" | "quarterly" | "yearly",
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  nextOccurrence: Date,
  ownerId: ObjectId,
  householdId: ObjectId,
  currency: String,
  isActive: Boolean,
  splitMethod: String,
  splitDetails: Array,
  paidBy: ObjectId,
  reminderDays: Number,
  timestamps: true
}
```

## üß™ Testing the Features

1. Create a household with multiple members
2. Add an expense to the household
3. Go to "Balances & Settlements" tab
4. Verify balances are calculated correctly

### Test Settlements:
1. View the suggested settlements
2. Click "Record Settlement"
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. Check that balances update accordingly

### Test Analytics:
1. Navigate to `/analytics`
2. View personal analytics
3. Switch to household view
4. Compare month-over-month spending

### Test Recurring Expenses:

3. Verify new expenses are created automatically

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

While these core features are implemented, consider adding:

1. **Frontend for Recurring Expenses**: Build a UI form component
2. **Receipt Scanning**: OCR for automatic expense entry
3. **Multi-Currency Conversion**: Real-time exchange rates
4. **Mobile App**: React Native version
5. **Notifications**: Email/push notifications for settlements
6. **Export**: PDF/CSV export for reports
7. **Graphs**: Interactive charts using Chart.js or Recharts

---

## üìù Notes

- The cron scheduler runs automatically when the backend starts
- All split calculations happen server-side to ensure accuracy
- Balances are calculated in real-time from expense data
- Settlement records are separate from expense splits for audit purposes

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Scheduler Not Running:
- Check backend logs for "Recurring expense scheduler started"
- Verify `node-cron` is installed: `npm list node-cron`

### Split Calculations Wrong:
- Verify household has members array populated
- Check `splitMethod` is one of the valid options
- Ensure `memberWeights` are set if using percentage split

### Analytics Not Loading:
- Check Redux state is properly initialized
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Check browser console for errors
