# SSL Certificate Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your ExpenseHub application with custom SSL certificates.

## Prerequisites

1. You have obtained SSL certificates from a certificate authority (e.g., Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, commercial CA)
2. You have the following certificate files:
   - **Full chain certificate** (fullchain.pem or certificate.crt)
   - **Private key** (privkey.pem or private.key)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Place Your Certificates

Copy your certificate files to the `certificates/` directory in your project root:

```bash
# From your project root
cp /path/to/your/fullchain.pem certificates/fullchain.pem
cp /path/to/your/privkey.pem certificates/privkey.pem
```

**File naming requirements:**
- Certificate chain must be named `fullchain.pem`
- Private key must be named `privkey.pem`

### 2. Verify Certificate Files

Ensure your certificate files are in the correct format:

```bash
# Check certificate
openssl x509 -in certificates/fullchain.pem -text -noout

# Check private key
openssl rsa -in certificates/privkey.pem -check

# Verify certificate and key match
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificates/fullchain.pem | openssl md5
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in certificates/privkey.pem | openssl md5
# The two hashes should match
```

### 3. Deploy SSL Certificates

You have two deployment options:

#### Option A: SSL Only (Update Existing Deployment)

If your application is already deployed and you just want to add/update SSL:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/ssl-custom.yml
```

#### Option B: Full Deployment with SSL

Deploy the entire application including SSL certificates:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/deploy-with-ssl.yml
```

Or run them separately:

```bash
# First deploy the application
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/deploy.yml

# Then deploy SSL
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/ssl-custom.yml
```

## What the Deployment Does

The SSL deployment playbook will:

1. âœ… Verify certificate files exist locally
2. âœ… Create secure SSL directory on the server
3. âœ… Copy certificates to the server with proper permissions
4. âœ… Configure Nginx to use custom certificates
5. âœ… Enable HTTPS on port 443
6. âœ… Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect
7. âœ… Apply security headers and SSL best practices
8. âœ… Restart Nginx and verify configuration

## Certificate Renewal

When your SSL certificates need to be renewed:

1. Obtain new certificates from your CA
2. Replace the files in the `certificates/` directory
3. Re-run the SSL deployment:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/ssl-custom.yml
```

## Security Notes

ðŸ”’ **Important Security Practices:**

- The `certificates/` directory is excluded from git via `.gitignore`
- Never commit certificate files to version control
- Private keys are stored with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- Certificate files are stored with 644 permissions (owner read/write, others read)
- All files are owned by the deployment user

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Validation Errors

If you get certificate validation errors:

```bash
# Check certificate expiry
openssl x509 -in certificates/fullchain.pem -noout -dates

# Verify certificate chain is complete
openssl verify -CAfile certificates/fullchain.pem certificates/fullchain.pem
```

### Nginx Configuration Errors

If Nginx fails to start:

```bash
# SSH to your server and check Nginx logs
ssh user@your-server
cd /opt/expensehub  # or your app_directory
docker compose logs nginx

# Test Nginx configuration
docker compose exec nginx nginx -t
```

### Port 443 Not Accessible

Ensure your firewall allows HTTPS traffic:

```bash
# On your server
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw status
```

## Nginx Configuration

The deployment creates a complete Nginx configuration at `ansible/templates/nginx-ssl-custom.conf.j2` that includes:

- **HTTP â†’ HTTPS redirect** on port 80
- **HTTPS server** on port 443 with:
  - TLS 1.2 and 1.3 support
  - Modern cipher suites
  - Session caching
  - Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
  - Gzip compression
  - Proper proxy configuration for frontend and backend
  - Health check endpoint

## Alternative: Let's Encrypt

If you prefer to use Let's Encrypt certificates with automatic renewal, use the original `ssl-setup.yml` playbook instead:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/production.ini ansible/ssl-setup.yml
```

Note: The original `ssl-setup.yml` uses Certbot and Let's Encrypt, while `ssl-custom.yml` is for custom/pre-existing certificates.

## Testing Your SSL Setup

After deployment, verify your SSL configuration:

```bash
# Test HTTPS connection
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check certificate details
echo | openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject

# Test SSL rating (optional)
# Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=your-domain.com
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Ansible playbook output for specific errors
2. Review server logs: `docker compose logs -f nginx`
3. Verify certificate files are valid and not expired
4. Ensure DNS is properly configured for your domain
